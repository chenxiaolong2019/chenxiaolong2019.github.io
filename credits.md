### [Econometrics](http://susannalles.github.io/)

Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships. More precisely, it is “the quantitative analysis of actual economic phenomena based on the concurrent development of theory and observation, related by appropriate methods of inference”.

## Acknowledgments

As many open source projects, Ed is the work of community. The project starts with the open web, and everything in between leading to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the wonderful team who wrangled that Ruby in our favor. The theme stylesheets are built on top of [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll theme based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), "the Jekyll butler," both created by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) and distributed with an MIT license. Thanks, Mark, for your helpful streamlining! Special hat tips to brother-in-markdown-arms, [Chris Forster](https://github.com/c-forster), and the generous [Sylvester Keil](https://github.com/inukshuk/) for his work on Jekyll Scholar.


We are strongly indebted to the research work and conversations stemming out of our [Columbia's Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/)—or as we like to call it: #xpmethod; the wonderful international comradery of [GO::DH](http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/); and of course, the support of our [Columbia University Libraries](http://library.columbia.edu/) and its cozy [Studio@Butler](https://studio.cul.columbia.edu/).

...and to the writers that inspire us to scribble notes on the margins we protect with our work. Thank you.
