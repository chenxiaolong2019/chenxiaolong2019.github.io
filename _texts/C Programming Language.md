There are someting about C Programming Language daily practices code, from after class practice for the corresponding textbooks,
*[C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition)-Stephen Prata](https://chenxiaolong2019.github.io/C-Programming-Language/C%20Primer%20Plus/C%20PRIME%20PLUS%20Project.zip)* and 
*[明解C语言入门篇（第三版）-【日】柴田望洋](https://chenxiaolong2019.github.io/C-Programming-Language/明解C语言/Project.zip)*. But they just inculde a part of class practices, not complete.
