# Derivation of "72 Law"

## What is "72 Law"

The so-called "72 law" is to calculate interest with 1% compound interest. After 72 years, the principal will double.

## Principle
The future value (FV) of periodic compound interest is:

$$FV = PV  (1+r)^t$$

PV is the present value, t is the number of periods, and r is the interest rate for each period.

When the investment doubles, $$FV=2PV$$. After substituting the above formula, it can be simplified to:

$$2 = (1+r)^t$$

Logarithm on both sides

$$ln2=t\times ln(1+r)$$

$$\frac{ln2}{ln(1+r)}=t$$

According to Taylor Series Approximation

$$ln(1+r) \approx r$$

also because

$$ln2\approx0.69$$

so

$$\frac{0.69}{r}\approx t$$

End
